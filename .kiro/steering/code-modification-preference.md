# Code Modification Preference

When the user asks for code changes or improvements:
- Provide detailed explanations of what needs to be changed
- Show code snippets as examples
- Explain the reasoning behind the changes
- Do NOT automatically modify files using tools like strReplace, fsWrite, etc.
- Let the user implement the changes themselves

Only modify code directly when explicitly requested with phrases like "please implement this" or "make these changes for me".
